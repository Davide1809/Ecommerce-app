# Reflection on E-Commerce App Project

## 1. What did you ask Copilot to help you build? How did you break down the problem?
I asked GitHub Copilot to help me build a simple e-commerce website with the following features:
- Product listings displayed in a grid
- "Add to Cart" and "Remove from Cart" functionality
- Shopping cart display with total price calculation
- Search bar to filter products by name or description

I broke the problem down into smaller tasks:
1. Generate the basic HTML structure with navbar and product grid
2. Style the page with CSS
3. Create product data in JavaScript
4. Render products dynamically using JS
5. Implement cart functionality
6. Add a search bar for filtering products

## 2. How did your approach to asking questions change as you worked?
Initially, I asked very general questions like "Create a cart," which gave overly complex or incomplete suggestions.  
Later, I learned to ask **specific, targeted prompts** such as:  
*"Create a JavaScript function that adds a product object to a cart array and updates the total price."*

## 3. What parts of the development process with GitHub Copilot surprised you?
- Copilot could generate working functions almost instantly.  
- Sometimes it suggested overly complicated code that needed simplification.  
- It helped me learn shortcuts and JS concepts I didnâ€™t know before, like `addEventListener` for input changes.

## 4. What did you learn about the technology you used that you didn't know before?
- Learned how to dynamically render HTML elements using JavaScript.  
- Learned how to filter an array of objects for search functionality.  
- Learned how to update totals and interact with the DOM efficiently.

## 5. What would you do differently if you had to build this again?
- Plan the features more clearly before starting to ask Copilot.  
- Test functions incrementally to catch errors early.  
- Use `localStorage` from the start for cart persistence.  
- Take screenshots as I work to save time for documentation.
